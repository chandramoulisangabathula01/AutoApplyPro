üìÑ Prompt for AI Web Builder
To initiate the development using an AI web builder, you can use the following prompt:

"Build a full-stack web application named 'AutoApply Pro' that allows users to automate job applications. The app should include Google Sign-In authentication, subscription-based access with Stripe integration, user profile management (including resume upload), and a dashboard to track applications. Additionally, develop a Firefox browser extension that auto-fills job application forms using AI-generated responses based on user data and job descriptions. The backend should be built with Node.js and Express.js, using MongoDB for data storage, and integrate OpenAI's API for generating tailored application responses."
